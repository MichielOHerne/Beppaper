% Some practical examples of how to insert information about your references (note that the selection of which info and which sequence is used is done by bibtex itself:
@article{AbedonHymanThomas2003,
	author = "Abedon, S. T. and Hyman, P. and Thomas, C.",
	year = "2003",
	title = "Experimental examination of bacteriophage latent-period evolution as a response to bacterial availability",
	journal = "Applied and Environmental Microbiology",
	volume = "69",
	pages = "7499--7506"
}

% entries can either be between parentheses (above), or between curly brackets (below):
@article{einstein1935can,
	title={Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?},
	author={Einstein, Albert and Podolsky, Boris and Rosen, Nathan},
	journal={Physical Review},
	volume={47},
	number={10},
	pages={777},
	year={1935},
	publisher={APS}
